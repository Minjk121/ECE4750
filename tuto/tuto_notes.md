# ECE4750

## DIS SEC03 NOTE
- Ad-Hoc vs. Assertion Testing
    - Ad-hoc is not automatic. & systematic
    - Assert in middle of the code
- Directed vs. Random Testing
- Black-Box vs. White-Box Testing
    - Black - only knowing the interface & specs
    - White - knowing implementation + specs
- Value vs. Delay Testing
- Unit vs. Integration Testing
    - Narrowed scope  = unit -> quicker
- Reference Models

- Overflow
    - 32b - 32b = lower 32 bits shown
    - In lab1, we are generating tinyRV1 MUL which produce the result with throwing away most significant 32 bits -> don’t care yet..
- Pytest
    - Use options 
        - -v: verbose
        - -s: line tracing
- imul/test
    - All the pytest codes
    - V1b, v1c = vector testing 
        - C = parametrized!
Latency insensitive microcontrol
- Fives sink the answer before the sink calculates from source
- Then source calc and check with the answer from the source

Random testing
- How do we know the result of the random input?
- Hard when the output is not predictable like network IP address
- How do we know if we have enough?
    - Think about path / (bit) toggle/functional COVERAGEs 

Delay testing is important
- Especially for the latency insensitive code
- Delaying the message from the source… etc
